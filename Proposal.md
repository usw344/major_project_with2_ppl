# Muhammad and Kam
# Final project proposal

## What we have
 * A way to gain money
 * Movement (on board screen), and makes it so you can’t move illegal places (a block that you aren’t touching
 * Switching through states (home screen, help screen, grid part of game, stickman fight)
 * Very basic ai for stickman fight
 * Movement and attack for stickman fight

## Description
Our game is a strategy game, that includes conquering places (like civilisation), but also a fight inbetween your character and the enemies. You will start with a small base, and you will be able to expand out by 1 each turn, as well, at the end of your turn, you will make 1 gold for each square you control. If you ever come into contact with the ai's territory, or you run into a random base, you will be engaged into the "Stickman Fight". In the stickman fight, you will have to fight an ai in the arena. For your hero, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons to end up doing more damage/getting ranged weapons the further you advance in the game. Finally to win, you will have to beat the ai, and conquer everything!!

## Must have
* Pretty good ai for both sides of game(grid and stick fight)
* Multiple weapons (stick fight)/in turn have a system to buy them using gold
* Multiple levels of difficulty for ai
* more than one level (randomize the place for the bases).

## Nice to have
* Good graphics
* Music/Sound effects
